# Demo Repository: Infrastructure & Frontend Sandbox

This repository serves as a testing ground for integrating **Frontend development** with **DevOps automation**. It focuses on building lightweight interfaces and validating them through automated CI/CD pipelines.

##  Tech Stack & Tools
* **Frontend:** HTML5 / JavaScript (Node.js environment)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`)
* **Package Management:** NPM / `package.json`

##  What’s Inside?
- **Automated Workflows:** The repository is configured with GitHub Actions to ensure code integrity on every push.
- **Dependency Management:** Utilizing `package.json` for a reproducible development environment.
- **Lightweight Deployment:** Ready for quick hosting tests (e.g., GitHub Pages or Vercel).

##  Purpose
I use this repository to prototype fast, web-based dashboards for my larger projects, such as the **HAaaS (Home-Assistant-as-a-Service)** management portal. It allows me to test UI changes before deploying them to production environments.
